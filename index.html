		<h3>A few selected programs</h3>
		<ul>

					TheQuestForPersepolis
				</a>
				<br>
				Written in Year 8. My first "major" program in Java; a text-based RPG game. Programming style was quite terrible, but 
				it was my first "real" exposure to programming.

					TeamGenerator
				</a>
				<br>
				Written in Year 10. Me and my friends liked to play video games, so I wrote this program which scrambles teams according 
				to player skill to automate the team-making process.

					SpaceGame
				</a>
				<br>
				Written in Year 10. We were meant to learn Greenfoot in CT class so I wrote this game as practice. Programming 
				technique was not refined back then but the game I made turned out to be quite popular in school. When I visited 
				the library during lunch, I would see many students playing my game.

					DriftwormGame
				</a>
				<br>
				Written in Year 11. We were given a class exercise in Science class where we would roll die and simulate the 
				evolution of driftworms. I thought that process was tedious so I wrote a program to automate the process.

					Sound
				</a>
				<br>
				Written in Year 11. This was originally a school exercise, but I extended the program so that it supports 
				user interaction through a CLI, undo/redo, save, and many other functions. Concurrent programming allowed 
				music to be played while being modified at the same time.

					AudioParty
				</a>
				<br>
				Written in Year 12. My friends and I sometimes blast music on our MacBook's speakers, but one problem we had 
				is that the music often isn't loud enough. This program would sync up all computers connected to a network 
				and play music at the same time so that the music would be loud enough. It was also good network programming 
				practice.

					CoinSums
				</a>
				<br>
				Written in Year 12. I wrote this to solve a Project Euler problem. It is a restricted integer partition 
				problem. Working on Project Euler has elevated my interest in mathematics, in particular, the intersection 
				between math and computer science. I have solved over 100 Project Euler problems. Some programming-based solutions 
				can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m0e48divv4htemm/AAD_wZDyT-VTPZlJRxAdqb5Pa?dl=0">here</a>.

					PhysicsSimulation
				</a>
				<br>
				Written in Year 12 / 13 (work in progress). I wrote this program to teach the basics of physics to students. 
				It includes simulations of different physical situations and a random question generator for many different 
				topics.

		<h3>Other stuff</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Math Internal Assessment
				<br>
				I'm doing my Math IA on an unsolved problem in combinatorics. I'm not done yet but I've made a few significant 
				findings.
